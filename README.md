# Kantinen 2012

This is my first attempt at creating a small game in [Inform
7](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/).


## Files

  - `story.ni`: This is the story file written in Inform 7.
  - `uuid.txt`: This is a universally unique identifier that Inform 7
    embeds into the compiled binary story file.
  - `*.nix`: These are [Nix](https://nixos.org/) files to help with
    developing, building, and running the code.


## Building and running

1. Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/).
2. Run `nix-shell`.
3. Run `make test`.

Please see the [Building and running section on
inform7-scaffolding](https://github.com/nqpz/inform7-scaffolding?tab=readme-ov-file#building-and-running)
for more options.
